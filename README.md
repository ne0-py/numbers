# Numberr

An android app interface for the Numbers API.
This app was created for personal use, to share this great API among my friends.

The app uses rounded corners and clean black and white colors for its widgets.
The background color of the cards is randomly generated.

### Thanks to the work of David and Mack for creating the [Numbers API](http://numbersapi.com)
